**# INTRO**


I have made an application and the name of application is blog application. So,
basically in this application u can perform all the CRUD operation i.e., all the users can
come to application and they can post articles, they can post blog, they can also upload
photo and they can write the title as well as summary part.

**About System**


The system runs Django Framework in back-end and HTML, CSS in front-end. The
project contains all the features of a Blog site like login/register into the system, add
blog post with title, description and image and edit or delete the blog post.
It has interactive UI design using which users can see what others are posting and
leave a comment. It also has an admin panel through which all the blog posts and
users can be managed.

**Difficulties**


When I was making this project, I wanted to add the authentication system by this only
authorized user can come in application. For this Django has features i.e., Django auth
from that I add the login system and register system and I connect with databases.


**BENEFITS OF PROJECT**


1. Data can be saved safely.
2. No other person cannot view other personâ€™s details
3. Greater efficiency
4. User friendliness
5. Minimum time required
6. Free of cost

**New Features**


I can add upvote or downvote whether u like this blog or not. And I wanted to add
the follower option like in Instagram.
